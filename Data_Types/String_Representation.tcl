#String Representation

if 0 {

Unlike other languages, in Tcl, you need not include double quotes when it's only a single
word. An example can be
}

set myvariable Hello

puts $myvariable

if 0 {

When we want to represent multiple strings, we can use either double quotes or curly
braces. It is shown below

}

set myvariable1 "Hello world"
puts $myvariable1

set myvariable2 {Hello World}
puts $myvariable2
